    When purchasing this product please leave a note in the sellers box stating your
    choice of ribbon color and any other modifications you would like. Although we
    encourage customization of our BK pieces to suit your needs, we will not copy any
    other outside designs.
  %p
    Because all BK designs are handmade and develop organically, patterns may vary
    slightly but will look very similar to the piece in photos. This enhances the free-
    spirited nature of the BK brand, and ensures our customers a true one of a kind
    piece.
